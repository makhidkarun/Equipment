description: |
  The Snap-7 snub pistol is designed for low-cost civilian self-defense. Ship crew often carry these when they're
  concerned about the types of people they have to do business with. The low-velocity bullets are safe aboard ship,
  and are low recoil when used in zero-G. Six charges are inserted into a revolving chamber (there is no magazine).
  
  The type of charge depends on the needs of the holder. The default charges are high-energy AP rounds, used to 
  defend against pirates or for the seedier parts of Startown. Tranq or gas charges are used for general 
  security purposes.
