description: |
  A highly ergonimic but short-ranged pistol for close work against
  unarmored targets such as startown thugs, some nobles, and some 
  wild animals. A 6-cartrige magazine contains custom AP projectiles, 
  which fire at 500 to 600 meters per second. The gun can be 
  fitted with a silencer.
