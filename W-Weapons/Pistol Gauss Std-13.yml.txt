description: |
  The gauss pistol is a popular weapon because of its
  silence and its deadliness. The gauss pistol is based 
  on the same principle as the gauss rifle and the VRF 
  gauss gun: an EM-effect hurls needlelike AP rounds at 
  1,500 meters per second. The gauss pistol may fire 
  either single-round shots or four shot bursts. The 
  pistol uses the same 4mm ammunition as the gauss rifle; 
  however, the magazines are not interchangeable.
