# Equipment
Repository for Traveller Armor, Robots, Vehicles, Weapons, and general Equipment

## Storage
Equipment data will be stored in tabbed-text format, with a README in each particular REPO describing the field order.
Fixed-fields seem to work very well for these data, which tend to have limited and well-defined fields.
Tabs are superior than other formats, because they are VERY easily split up and allow the trivial use of quotes and commas in the data fields.

## Format
Equipment is stored using T5's equipment catalog system, which uses each letter to define one category.
Beyond that, the rules used to create the equipment is appended to the end of the base filename for clarity.

### Example: Weapon

### Example: Armor

### Example: Robot

### Example: Vehicle

## Inter-Compatibility

The format for each particular ruleset don't have to match other rulesets; it's better to create utilities that can convert
from one format to the other than to try to force all rulesets to follow even a base set of common data.

Internally, the equipment data must follow a consistent format based on that ruleset.
